                <h2>ABOUT HOTPOT RESTAURANT</h2>
                <p>This is one of the best <span>chinese restaurant</span> in this city. We serves Chinese cuisine mostly and people<br>also liked very much this chinese cuisine. Most of the chinese dishes mainly started with
                <br>Cantonese style, due to the history of the CHINESE Cuisine diaspora,through other regional cuisines
            <br> such as Sichuan cuisine and Hakka cuisine are also common. These restaurant mainly designed for <span>take out</span>
        <br>,as opposed to traditional eat-in restaurants which typically offer take-out as an option;such take-out restaurants
    <br>out as an option,such take-out are often simplistic and lack tables or seats.</p>

                <h2>ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN</h2>
                <p>This article is the third in a series that covers how the Mobile team at Swiggy built the Delivery Partner app. The first article covers the need, challenges involved, research conducted and how the team got together to build the new Delivery Partners app. The Second article covers identifying the requirements, tech evaluations and why we have chosen React Native.</p>
                <h3>First things first: The Design principles</h3>
                <p>Keeping in mind to set good quality of the codebase standards, reusability of the code (we are lazy programmers!), futuristic approach (less rework), faster rollouts, A/B experimentation, plug-play-unplug use cases, unit testing, agility in integrating any 3rd party modules etc. we have laid out the below principles to stick to while building this app (Like how celestial bodies revolve around the Sun, our codebase revolves around these principles).</p>
                <h4>Separation of Concerns</h4>
                <p>Our application is feature-rich and complex in serving the data needed to complete each delivery workflow. This involves handling user interactions, business logic, data sync and storage, network transactions, instrumentation of data such as user journey, touchpoints, real-time health metrics, etc. to name a few concerns. Instead of sprinkling these concerns all over the code base which becomes a developers nightmare to change/clean-up/revamp the code related to any concern, we separated these concerns either by creating a module or exposing a framework so that dependent modules can ignore the implementation details and be extensible to build upon.</p>
